Mac OS X comes with Python 2.7 out of the box, so you should be good to go.

**Install Instructions**
1. Download zip of code from the Code button
2. Unzip and move the contents of the file to your desired folder
3. Open terminal on your mac by opening spotlight and typing in 'terminal' then pressing enter
4. In terminal navigate to the folder where the code lives. You can check your current folder by typing ```pwd```, the contents of your current folder by typing ```ls```, and moving a folder by typing ```cd <folder name>```. If you want to back out of a folder and go up a level, type ```cd ..```.
5. Once in the folder where the code lives, simply type ```python3 main.py``` to run the script.

Criteria notes: Type all of the criteria you want in the file criteria.csv. If a criterion text has a comma in it, simply put the whole criterion in quotes. Also, be sure each search criterion is spelled correctly and includes the correct punctuation, e.g. Business LLC vs "Business, L.L.C."
